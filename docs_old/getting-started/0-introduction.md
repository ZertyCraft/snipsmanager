In this tutorial, you will deploy an assistant to a Raspberry Pi in a few minutes. We assume that you have the following items at your disposal:

- A computer, running either macOS or Linux
- A Raspberry Pi Model 3, running Jessie Lite of later
- A USB microphone for the Raspberry Pi
- A speaker for the Raspberry Pi

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how it all works, so you can make the most out of Snips.
