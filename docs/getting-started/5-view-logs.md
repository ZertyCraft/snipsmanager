At times, it is useful to inspect what is going on with your device while it is running.

You can inspect the real-time logs on your system as follows:

```sh
$ sam logs
2017-10-27T21:00:20+01:00 sam[system]: Device started
2017-10-27T21:00:25+01:00 sam[mqtt]: New message on topic /hermes/hotword/toggleOn
2017-10-27T21:00:25+01:00 sam[mqtt]: New message on topic /hermes/asr/toggleOn
2017-10-27T21:00:25+01:00 sam[mqtt]: New message on topic /hermes/hotword/toggleOff
```

You may filter on log tag using the `--tag` flag:

```sh
$ sam logs --tag=mqtt
```

To view all the logs, add the `--all` flag. This might be long, so you may want to pipe the output to a file:

```sh
$ sam logs --all > logs.txt
```

### Watching messages

Alternatively, you can watch only the intents which are being detected. For this, use the `watch` command:

```sh
$ sam watch
â†¯ Hotword detected

```
